# Contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

## File structure

All the contents hosted as [mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web](https://mshibanami.github.io/redirect-web/) are in the [docs](docs) folder.

Contents of the library available on the app are in [library](library). If you want to modify the contents, please check [README.md in the folder](library/README.md).

## Livereload

The documentation is powered by Docsify, and you can livereload it with their `docsify-cli`.
Please check [their repository](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli), and install it.

Once it's ready, run this command in the repository root:

```sh
$ docsify serve docs/
```

Livereload makes maintaining the documentation easier.
